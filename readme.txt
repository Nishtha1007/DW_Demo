In order to be able to execute the demos in this course, you need to have the following databases:
1. HappyScoopers_Demo (the source database)
2. HappyScoopers_DW (the data warehouse)

For creating the databases, execute these scripts in the following order:
- 01 - Create HappyScoopers_Demo
- 02 - Populate HappyScoopers_Demo
- 03 - Create foreign keys
- 04 - Create HappyScoopers_DW


ATTENTION:
In the two scripts that create the databases (01 and 04), you need to provide the path where you want the databases to be created.
This should be an existing path from your machine (ex: D:\Pluralsight\Databases). 
Before executing the scripts, replaces all occurences of the string: {LOCAL_PATH} with the path on your machine.
